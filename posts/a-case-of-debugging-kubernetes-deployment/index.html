The title should have been worded as something like &laquo;A new mysterious
ReplicaSet replaces the original one soon after its Deployment has
been created&raquo;. What&rsquo;s important is that this new ReplicaSet fails
to start.

In hindsight the case seems rather trivial, but at the time I saw the
issue it didn&rsquo;t feel like that. The first suspect was the code of
Kubernetes mistakenly firing up an unneeded ReplicaSet, thus I needed
a way to hunt down the culprit in the code.

How do people debug such issues? Isn&rsquo;t there a proven methodology, a more
or less systematic approach to solving similar puzzles. I&rsquo;m not aware
of any. Not only me
is asking such questions it seems. So, I decided to copy my comment
from the issue discussion to this blog.

The title should have been worded as something like &laquo;A new mysterious
<code>ReplicaSet</code> replaces the original one soon after its <code>Deployment</code> has
been created&raquo;. What&rsquo;s important is that this new <code>ReplicaSet</code> fails
to start.</p>

<p>In hindsight the case seems rather trivial, but at the time I saw the
issue it didn&rsquo;t feel like that. The first suspect was the code of
Kubernetes mistakenly firing up an unneeded <code>ReplicaSet</code>, thus I needed
a way to hunt down the culprit in the code.</p>

is asking such questions it seems. So, I decided to copy my comment
from the issue discussion to this blog.</p>

<p></p>

<p>My style of debugging is trial and error led by my intuition. But here
is the scheme I usually use:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Reproduce the issue locally. Usually this is the most time consuming
step.</p></li>

<li><p>Look into all available logs for anything weird or strange (nothing
interesting here this time).</p></li>

<li><p>Try to build an older version of Kubernetes, as old as possible. And see
if the issue is reproducible. Then in case it&rsquo;s not use <code>git bisect</code> to
find the offending commit. Unfortunately the issue is reproducible even
with K8s 1.8.0.</p></li>

<li><p>Examine the content of the objects in question (<code>ReplicaSet</code>s) using
<code>kubectl describe ...</code>. How objects of the same type differ from each
other. If some objects are mutable try to find out how their content
gets updated (<code>Deployment</code>). Here I found out that the new replica set lacks
tolerations and the deployment is not immutable.</p></li>

<li><p>Find the code which runs upon deployment updates and increase its log
verbosity. It turned out the relevant code is the deployment controller
of <code>kube-contoller-manager</code>. This environment variable increases log
verbosity for the code <code>LOG_SPEC=deployment_controller*=5,replica_set*=5,sync*=5,recreate*=5</code>.
The only outcome on this step was the confirmation that the deployment
gets updated.</p></li>

<li><p>Modify the sync handler for <code>Deployment</code> objects to log what exactly has
changed (this lib can be used to do the diff <a href="https://github.com/d4l3k/messagediff">https://github.com/d4l3k/messagediff</a>).
Here we see that the only change was the removal of the tolerations.</p></li>

<li><p>Look for code which actually does update <code>Deployment</code> through the API server
with this command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ git grep Deployments | grep <span style="color:#d14">&#34;Update(&#34;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are only few places in Kubernetes where <code>Deployment</code>s get updated,
but none looks relevant. This leads to the hypothesis that the source of
the update is somewhere outside of Kubernetes.</p></li>

<li><p>Take a closer look at the YAML files. They seem to be quite complex.</p></li>

<li><p>Try to make the setup as simple as possible where the issue is still
reproducible. Here I found that small one line changes in different YAML
files lead to the issue being not reproducible - the setup is too fragile.</p></li>

<li><p>Then look through the YAMLs line by line in the hope to find something
interesting. The interesting bit here is that the deployment operates
on behalf of the <code>kube-state-metrics</code> service account which requests
permission to do <code>update</code> on <code>Deployment</code>s.</p></li>

<li><p>Drop this permission. This confirms that the Deployment doesn&rsquo;t
change any more.</p></li>

<li><p>Look into the logs of the running pod. Bingo! In <code>addon-resizer</code>&rsquo;s logs
there is an error about inability to update the <code>Deployment</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Try to find the sources of <code>addon-resizer:1.0</code>. This turned out to be
not easy task, because the version 1.0 is <strong>very</strong> old. Apparently the
culprit is K8s API has evolved too much since v1.0. Looking at <code>PodSpec</code>
used in <code>addon-resizer:1.0</code> confirms it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, it turned out the problem is in the outdated container image
<code>quay.io/coreos/addon-resizer:1.0</code> of the deployment.</p>

<p>It runs a client which updates the <code>kube-state-metrics</code> deployment. But the
client uses outdated API which lacks <code>Tolerations</code> in <code>PodSpec</code>. As result
the updated deployment looses tolerations in its pod template. The deployment
controller recreates <code>ReplicaSet</code>. The pods controlled by the new <code>ReplicaSet</code>
lack tolerations as well and fail to run on the tainted node.</p>
